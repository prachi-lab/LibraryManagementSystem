# LibraryManagementSystem
## Introduction
  created an online web application for the 
  purpose of eﬃcient and eﬀective Library 
  Management System in any institute for students.
## Problem Statement
  We know that as in any college or university, for issuing books, students have to go to the Main library (which has around 1.5 lakh books) and then find the books they wish to borrow. Although having separate compartments for similar kind of books based on department and genres, the process of browsing through the large shelfs in the physical library could be cumbersome.
  
  In order to resolve all these problems, we decided to create this project.
